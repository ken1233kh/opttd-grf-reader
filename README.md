# opttd-grf-reader
This program was designed so I could create/modify grf files.
I use in in conjunction with:
grfcodec to handle the compiling/decompiling of the GRF file
gimp to view and modify the png files
any text editior to modify the nfo files

codeblocks is used to compile the code.
wxWidgets is used to handle the gui screen

there are a lot of hacks in the code which can be improved, but it is useful as is
